# Business Process Description

Design a SQL Server application that implements a `Conference Management System` called `ConfMSmini`.

NOTES: 
- You (the AI Agent) **must not** edit this file.
- Human reader (not the AI):
  1. Copy and paste `Follow instructions in current file` into the Agent-Mode chat window.
  2. You'll need to type `proceed` about 15 times. (HINT: arrow up key to repeat)
  3. After the final step, the response should be something like: "Your SQL Database Project is now complete and fully tested".  
    - You should have about "40 files changed", press the `Keep` button.

# Business Process Operations

The operations per role are:

- All Roles (these operations are available to all roles)
  - Register as a user
    - Register as user should generate a unique username (if one is not passed in) using the First Name and Last Name, it must be unique.  By default use the first 6 characters of the first name, and the first two characters of the 2nd name.  If the username is not unique, append a number to the end of the username, starting with 1.  For example, if the first name is "John" and the last name is "Doe", the username would be "johndo".  If that username already exists, the next one would be "johndo1", and so on.
    - Takes a role type as parameter (attendee, speaker, organizer)
  - Get username
    Based on first name and last name return the username.
  - See a list of conferences (that haven't happened yet)
- Organizer
  - Register as a user
  - Add a conference
  - Add a ticket type
  - See ticket sales
    - See a list of tickets sold for a conference
  - Generate Schedule
    - Generates a schedule for a conference, based on the sessions (which includes their length) and the speakers. Ensure a speaker is not scheduled for more than one session at the same time.  Ensure sessions start are 9am, and end by 5pm.  Ensure lunch is 12pm to 1pm.
